# AwesomePrefs

AwesomePrefs is a rewrite of the `android.preference` framework for preferences. The reason for doing this is that in "Boid for Android" bugs were occuring where settings wouldn't set at all, and it was too rigid to work at all.

## Known issues:

* Not 100% compatible with Android Preferences (but works for most things)
* No Tablet Support (YET!)
